description:
Operators can be specified multiple ways.

Having consistent code guidelines for those cases is a good idea.

Use the following table to decide which operator to use:

| Discouraged operator | Preferred operator |
| --- | --- |
| `GT` | `>` |
| `LT` | `<` |
| `EQ` | `=` |
| `NE` | `<>` |
| `GE` | `>=` |
| `LE` | `<=` |
