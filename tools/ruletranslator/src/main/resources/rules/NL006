description:
Operators can be specified multiple ways. Having consistent code guidelines for those cases is a good idea.

This behavior can be configured using the `natls.style.comparisons` option in the [analyzer configuration](/docs/analyzer-config.md)

Use the following table to decide which operator to use with the preferred operator configuration set as `signs`

| Discouraged operator | Preferred operator |
| --- | --- |
| `GT` | `>` |
| `LT` | `<` |
| `EQ` | `=` |
| `NE` | `<>` |
| `GE` | `>=` |
| `LE` | `<=` |

For preferred operator configuration set as ``short``, the table look like this:

| Discouraged operator | Preferred operator |
| --- | --- |
| `>` | `GT` |
| `<` | `LT` |
| `=` | `EQ` |
| `<>` | `NE` |
| `>=` | `GE` |
| `<=` | `LE` |
