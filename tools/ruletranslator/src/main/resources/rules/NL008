name: Test names are duplicated
priority: BLOCKER

type: BUG
description:
A test with this name is already defined in this module.

Having multiple tests with the same name results in each test being run multiple times and also each test being run each time
the test module is called with the test name.

This leads to unpredictable behavior.
