name: Statement Label duplicated
priority: BLOCKER
tags: compile-time
type: BUG
description:
A statement label has to be unique within a module.

This leads to a compile error:

```natural
F1. FOR #I := 1 TO 10
    IGNORE
END-FOR

F1. FOR #I := 1 TO 10
    IGNORE
END-FOR
```

To fix this, you'd have to change one label.

```natural
F1. FOR #I := 1 TO 10
    IGNORE
END-FOR

/* Label changed
F2. FOR #I := 1 TO 10
    IGNORE
END-FOR
```
