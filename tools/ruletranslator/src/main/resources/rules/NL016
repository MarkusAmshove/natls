description:
The variable that this ``COMPRESS`` is compressing into is used as a file path for a ``DEFINE WORK FILE``.

The ``COMRESS`` does not specify ``LEAVING NO SPACE``, which can result in the file path containing spaces where
they are not expected (e.g. a leading space in the file name).

Add ``LEAVING NO SPACE``.
