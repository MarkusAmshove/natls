description:
Imaging a PDA named `PDANAME`, the data structure is expected to be as follows:

```natural
1 PDANAME /* (only 1 level 1)
  2 PDANAME-IN /* (groups for input, output and optionally input/output)
    3 ....
  2 PDANAME-OUT
    3 ....
```

Optionally `PDANAME-INOUT` can be a group too - it can even be standalone, if all your parameters are input/output (rare).

A PDA structure should follow these rules in order to be able to access each area individually through `RESET` and `MOVE BY NAME` statements, and to mention the fewest parameters in `CALLNAT`'s/`PERFORM`'s, which improves readability.

```natural
CALLNAT 'SUBPGM' USING PDANAME
PERFORM EXTERNAL-SUBROUTINE-NAME PDANAME
```

If you have array groups, these are only possible at level > 2.

This behavior can be configured using the `natls.style.in_out_groups` option in the [analyzer configuration](/docs/analyzer-config.md)
