description:
Subroutines with names longer than 32 characters get cut to 32 characters at compilation time.

Having a subroutine with a longer name is no problem in itself, as it can help the developer to express its intend more clear.

This issue is only raised if there is a subroutine with a name longer than 32 characters and a `PERFORM` which uses a different subroutine
name but having the first 32 characters match.

## Example

```natural
DEFINE SUBROUTINE THIS-IS-A-LONG-SUBROUTINE-NAME-WHICH-IS-CUT
...
END-SUBROUTINE

PERFORM THIS-IS-A-LONG-SUBROUTINE-NAME-WHERE-THE-MOST-PART-MATCHES
```

At compilation time, the subroutine name is cut to `THIS-IS-A-LONG-SUBROUTINE-NAME-W` which results in the correct subroutine
to be called by the `PERFORM`.

However, the names differ in the source code, which is very confusing.
