Typed variables should always be qualified with their (top) group name to improve readability.

Consider this `DEFINE DATA` structure:

```natural
DEFINE DATA
LOCAL
1 #WORK
  2 #MYVAR (N1)
END-DEFINE
```

Now, this is the correct way to write a `MOVE` statement:

`MOVE 1 TO #WORK.#MYVAR` (as opposed to `MOVE 1 TO #MYVAR`)

This behavior can be configured using the `natls.style.disallowtoplevelvars` option in the [analyzer configuration](/docs/analyzer-config.md)
