Typed variables should always be qualified with their (top) group name to improve readability.

Consider this DEFINE DATA structure:
DEFINE DATA
LOCAL
1 #WORK
  2 #MYVAR (N1)
END-DEFINE

Now, this is the correct way to write a MOVE statement:

MOVE 1 TO #WORK.#MYVAR (as opposed to MOVE 1 TO #MYVAR)
