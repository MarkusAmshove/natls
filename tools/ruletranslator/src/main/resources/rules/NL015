name: COMPRESS target is used as work file path without LEAVING NO SPACE
priority: MAJOR
tags: pitfall, confusing, suspicious
type: BUG
description:
The variable that this `COMPRESS` is compressing into is used as a file path for a `DEFINE WORK FILE`.

The `COMRESS` does not specify `LEAVING NO SPACE`, which can result in the file path containing spaces where
they are not expected (e.g. a leading space in the file name).

## Problem

```natural
#FILENAME := 'file.txt'
COMPRESS '$HOME/folder/' #FILENAME INTO #FILEPATH
DEFINE WORK FILE 1 #FILEPATH
```

The resulting file path will contain a space: `$HOME/folder/ file.txt`.

## Solution

Add `LEAVING NO SPACE`:

```natural
#FILENAME := 'file.txt'
COMPRESS '$HOME/folder/' #FILENAME INTO #FILEPATH LEAVING NO SPACE
DEFINE WORK FILE 1 #FILEPATH
```

The resulting file path will contain a space: `$HOME/folder/file.txt`.
