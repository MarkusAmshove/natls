name: Level 1 typed variables is discouraged

description:
A typed variable should always have a group parent, so that it can be qualified.

Consider this `DEFINE DATA` structure:
```natural
DEFINE DATA
LOCAL
1 #MYVAR1 (N1)
1 #WORK
  2 #MYVAR2 (N1)
END-DEFINE
```

`#MYVAR1` is incorrectly defined on level 1, whereas `#MYVAR2` is defined correctly with a group parent.

This behavior can be configured using the `natls.style.qualifyvars` option in the [analyzer configuration](/docs/analyzer-config.md)
